          <p>Yes, yes it is. It may look a little dark and 
          hard to see, but that figure to the right of this paragraph of text 
          is indeed <i>me</i>. Where was I when this picture was taken? The thing is, I 
          don't remember. It's anyone's guess, but I refuse to guess myself, 
          because honestly, <i>I</i> of all people should know for sure where I was when 
          this picture was taken - I was <i>there</i>, after all - yet I do not 
          actually know. What I conclude from this is that I do have the 
          ability to figure out exactly where I was when this picture was 
          taken, without the need to guess. However, as that requires effort, 
          I have elected not to do so. Which is always a nice choice in most 
          cases. Most of the time.
          <h3 class="center">Anyway,</h3>
          <p>Welcome all, welcome to my <b>homepage</b>! Here, you 
          will find a couple of things, which might be of interest to you, 
          though most likely they'll be boring. They're mostly content dug 
          out from other things I've done, after all.</p>

        <p>First, a little background: So, it turned out that 
        ethics was, like, <b>really</b> important for Computer Science, and we all have to  
        think about it a <i>little</i>. Well, if 1500 words count as little, then this 
        page is the result of me applying a little thought to the subject of 
        ethics, and I have chosen the topic of Justice-based ethics because... 
        um... Actually, I didn't really <i>choose</i> it. It was simply the one left over, 
        which I picked, since I didn't really have any particular preference for 
        any one ethical framework, nor do I care about them <i>particularly</i> much. So, 
        here is the essay. In full, converted from the original <span class="emph">
        Latex</span> to <span class="emph">html</span>. <b>Attempt</b> to enjoy. Don't force
        yourself.

        <p>This little rhythm game would be my answer to <i>"What was your first web 
        project?"</i>. Made in collaboration with three other people, this 
        rhythm game was created over a two-week period of a <span 
        class="emph">javascript/svg</span> course. While it was by no means my 
        first programming project, nor the first game I have ever programmed, this 
        game was my first time programming in a real-ish programming language, and the 
        first time I've ever worked with <span class="emph">svg</span> graphics. 
        For a little two-week project, I'd say it is not bad - it even loads its 
        timing values from a <span class="emph">csv</span> file, which means I can 
        swap out the song if I need or want to.</p>

        <p>Did you know that this page is the first <span class="emph">HTML</span> 
        project I've ever 
        worked on? Now you know! Because I needed to find my way around this 
        <span class="emph">HTML</span> stuff, I needed a starting point, a way to 
        test the tools at my arsenal, to roughly gauge what I can do with it. And 
        that was the result: a mass of unrelated content, strange animations, and 
        self-referencing paragraphs. It was styled slightly differently from the 
        rest of the pages, with larger margins on the left and right sides, 
        but then I decided that smaller margins looked better, so now it has small 
        margins again..</p>
