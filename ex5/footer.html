    This is a bunch of text at the end that nobody ever reads. I wonder what 
    they're for? Sometimes, on big websites, they have more navigation down here 
    for more seldom-used functions you're supposed to actively look for, but other 
    times, it says some strange things in grey text on a dark background or 
    something, and I never bothered to read them. Actually, they might be 
    navigation too. Who knows, I've never read them. <br>
