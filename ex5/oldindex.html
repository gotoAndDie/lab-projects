      <p>Hello! Welcome to an <i>experimental</i> page, made by somebody with 
      <b> no design sense whatsoever</b>! Here, you will find some rudimentary 
      experiments in <span class="emph">HTML</span> and <span class="emph"> CSS 
      </span>- no scripts! - along with some content I've made that you 
      <i>may</i> be interested in. It used to be the homepage too, until I made 
      a better organized one. &ltbye&gt</p>

      <h2 class="center">So why was this page made?</h2>
      <p>Would you believe that this is literally the first time I've used html? 
      Seriously, even my last web project did not use html or css at all. You 
      can see that web project in the Game page of this website - it is in an 
      iframe here, which is linked to an svg image file with embeded 
      javascript, no html involved. This is why I must work extra hard on 
      this project, in order to obtain the necessary expertise on html and 
      css, two of the basic building blocks of the web, so that I can help build an 
      awesome web application for the team project. Let's all work hard!</p>
      <!-- Side by Side paragraphs-->
      <table><tr>
        <td class="wide50">
          <h3>Why is this page so disorganized?</h3>
          <p>Because there isn't really any point to this page. 
          This page is a sandbox for me to test various html and css elements so 
          that I will know how to make a web page when I actually have something 
          to write about. Here, though, I'm just throwing a bunch of unrelated 
          content together in different layout elements, without some core 
          content to draw you to, so it is quite chaotic.</p>
        </td>
        <td class="wide50">
          <h3>Will this homepage be replaced later?</h3>
          <p>Maybe. Probably. This is the first page I've ever 
          made in html, so it is more about testing than actual content. Given 
          that this page lives inside the aboutme directory, though, I'm assuming 
          that it'd probably be nice if I put in something like a well-formatted 
          self introduction in the future. Perhaps, by the time you see this 
          page, it would've already been filed under the Experiments tab above.
          Where it now resides.</p>
