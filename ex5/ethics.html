    <h1>An introduction to the Justice-based Ethics</h1>
    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>Ethical frameworks are an important part of human societies, from the most primitive societies of the past, to the most advanced societies of the future. Although we may not be aware of their effects, ethical frameworks guide our every action, our every decision, and our every thought, driving the immeasurably complex machine that is the human society. Many ethical frameworks operate on the personal level, and dictate only how a single person should act - how the actions of one person can be ethical or unethical. Justice-based ethics is somewhat different in this regard. </p>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>Justice-based ethics function not only on the level of each person, but on society as a whole. An example of this ethical framework existed in the Law Code of Hammurabi, a code of ethics in Ancient Mesopotamia, which held that "all free men should be treated alike, just as all slaves should be treated alike. Essentially, the principle of justice is that given any number of alike entities, your actions and attitudes upon them should be alike, as should their actions and attitude upon you; conversely, given any entities that are similar to you, you can expect to be treated similarly to them, as should you act similarly to them. In the end, equality is the basis of justice-based ethics, but also its greatest weakness. For example, treating free men and slaves differently is considered immoral in the modern world, but was once the norm. Therefore, this ethical framework depends heavily on the society it is applied in, producing different ethical conclusions in each case.</p>
    <h1>Analysis: The case of the Killer Robot</h1>
    <h2>Case introduction</h2>
    <p>The Case of the Killer Robot is a fictional scenario conceived in 1994, concerning the need for ethics in software engineering, and how ethical deviations can lead to disastrous consequences. It features the fictional company Silicon Techtronics, which produced a faulty robot arm that killed its operator, and the various factors behind this incident. Many unethical decisions were made during the robot arm's development, and these decisions shall be analysed with justice-based ethics below.</p>
    <h2>Analysis by Decision</h2>
    <h3>Mike Waterson's Threat</h3>
    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>Mike Waterson threatened to fire the entire robotics division if the product is delayed.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>Mike Waterson was the CEO of Silicon Techtronics, who held immense power over the entire corporation. His threat to fire the robotics department was very real, putting immense pressure upon the robotics department to complete the project on time. This resulted in a rushed development, leading to a host of other bad decisions that ultimately crippled the project.</p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>It's unknown if other departments receive equal treatment, but Mike Waterson's responsibility upon the robot arm project should be equal to that of the robotics division's. Therefore, it is unjust that he would fire the robotics department without resigning.</p>
    <h3>Sam Reynolds' Appointment</h3>
    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>Sam Reynolds was appointed as the robotics project leader by Mike Waterson.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>Sam Reynolds did not possess the technical skills needed to lead a robotics project, having been transferred from the data processing division for reasons unrelated to his lack of robotics expertise. He was also unaware of his lack of technical expertise, and made decisions that negatively affected the project.</p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>Only a minority (at most) of the robotics department supported his appointment to the post. As Mike Waterson's opinions were considered above the opinions of the robotics department, this decision was not just.</p>
    <h3>The Waterfall Model</h3>
    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>The Waterfall Model of software development was chosen over the Prototype Model, courtesy of Sam Reynolds.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>Sam Reynolds, due to his background in data processing, chose the Waterfall Model, which he was more familiar with, over the Prototype model, which was supported by his staff and was more suited to the project. The use of the Waterfall Model led to a product that was difficult for operators to use, which contributed to the incident.</p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>Again, Sam Reynolds' decision was being considered above the opinions of most other employees in the robotics decision, which was unfair.</p>
    <h3>The Early Shipping</h3>
    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>The robot arm was shipped out, despite being unfinished and was internally known to be buggy.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>Due to Mike Waterson's pressure upon the robotics department, Ray Johnson, the chief of the robotics division, insisted on the robot arm's timely release. As a result, the robot arm was shipped despite the presence of bugs, and tests had to be faked to so that the product may be shipped on time.</p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>The question here is whether Ray Johnson or Mike Waterson would take a gift that could kill them, just as they would release a product that could kill other people. There's no evidence in the story either way, but it was highly unlikely that they would not. Therefore, their decision was unfair.</p>
    <h3>Limited Training</h3>
    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>Robot operators for the robot arm were trained for only 8 hours, when the requirements specified 40 hours.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>A robot arm is a fairly complicated contraption, and 40 hours of training, including detailed instructions on every operation and exceptional conditions, should have been included. However, only 8 hours of training in one work day was provided, and the operators were not informed of the meaning of exceptions.</p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>The fact that the requirements specified 40 hours of training implied that operators of other machinery did receive 40 hours of training. Therefore, to deprive the robot arm operators of their required training is unfair.</p>
    <h3>Faking Tests</h3>
    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>The test results of the robot arm were faked to facilitate its timely release.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>It was decided by the head of the robotics division to fake the robot arm's tests, and this decision was not rejected by the employee responsible for the testing. As a result, the bug that caused robot operator's death was kept secret, and the robot arm was released in a dangerous state.</p>
    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>Outrage was produced over the lack of testing, indicating that other manufacturers do test their product thoroughly. Therefore, to fake test results is immoral, as it deviates from the common behaviour of a company.</p>
    <h1>Comparison to Other Ethical Frameworks</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>It is always important to compare; without comparison, knowledge will stagnate. Therefore, in the section below, I shall compare justice-based ethics to six other ethical frameworks, to give a more detailed picture of the morality landscape.</p>
    <h2>Comparison: Consequentialist ethics</h2>
    <p>Consequentialist ethical frameworks generally concern achieving a greater good, where the end justifies the means. This contrasts justice-based ethics, which is non-consequentialist, concerning the morality of actions rather than results. Consequentialist ethical framework include:</p>
    <h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
    <p>Utilitarianism views "good" as the happiness of each target affected by our actions, and instructs us to evaluate our every action to produce the most happiness. Unlike justice-based ethics, utilitarianism defines good and bad in the form of "happiness" and "unhappiness", and concerns only the results produced by each individual.</p>
    <h3>Egoism</h3>
    <p>Egoism concerns only the happiness of oneself. It is a highly practical framework often applied unconsciously in reality, but is rarely advocated due to its inherent selfishness. In this aspect, it is quite similar to justice-based ethics, which can be used by a selfish society to immoral ends, but justice-based ethics is less criticized as societal norms are rarely deliberate products of malice, while egoism can be abused to justify any arbitrary malicious action.</p>
    <h3>The Approach of Common Good</h3>
    <p>Like justice-based ethics, the approach of common good concerns society - that your actions should contribute to an ethical society, created by the actions of its people. It differs in that it directs a person to make the society good, while justice-based ethics direct a person to follow what the society considers to be good - an inversion.</p>
    <h2>Comparison: Non-consequentialist ethics</h2>
    <p>In contrary, non-consequentialist ethical frameworks concern the actions themselves, rather than their consequences. They define a set of rules by which each action must follow, and therefore dictate whether an action is moral or immoral. Justice-based ethics is non-consequentialist, as are:</p>
    <h3>Duty-based Ethics</h3>
    <p>Duty-based ethics specify that each person must produce their own ethical obligations, created through discovering rules that can be applied universally without contradiction. This interacts with justice-based ethics in that universal rules within a group of equals lie at justice's heart, with the fact that such a universal rule already exists within society justifying its following. However, while duty-based ethics require each person to create their own rules, justice-based ethics mostly emphasizes following existing rules.</p>
    <h3>The Rights Approach</h3>
    <p>The rights approach stipulates that all entities have rights, and, unlike other frameworks, only specifies that actions violating others' rights are immoral, rather than specifying any moral actions. This approach relies on fairness, a main part of justice-based ethics, to evaluate the rights of each entity, as it would be impractical to assess each entity's rights individually. As a result, actions permitted by the rights approach can be similar to those produced by justice-based ethics.</p>
    <h2>Comparison: Agent-centered Theories</h2>
    <p>Agent-centered theories concern a person's virtues throughout their life, to judge the person's character. Agent-centered theories are difficult to compare with other ethical frameworks, as they cannot judge the morality of individual actions or consequences, instead urging us to be a judge of character. A person's ethical framework leads them to express various virtues; for example, an adherent of justice-based ethics would possess the virtue of justice, but otherwise there are few connections.</p>
